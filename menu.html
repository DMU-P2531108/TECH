            This is achieved by the use of audio controls that support three (3) different audio formats: mp3, m4a, and ogg. This is done to
            eliminate the possibility of audio failure caused by browser compatibility issues. Another method of audio that was debated was
            wrapping the audio in a button, which gives a more compact visual effect that is easier to find on the websites.-->
